# 🛡️ MyMesh  
**Your reputation, protected by your network.**

A seamless, privacy-first platform to protect crypto creators from impersonation and reputation attacks. Built with Civic Auth + Wagmi + Oasis Sapphire, MyMesh provides completely abstracted Web3 interactions to **detect malicious content**, **verify creator authenticity**, and **delegate reputation management** without exposing user privacy or requiring crypto knowledge.

## 🎯 What We Built

**MyMesh** integrates Oasis privacy technology into **two distinct clients** that work together to provide comprehensive creator protection:

- **Seamless Login**: Civic Auth + Wagmi integration for zero-friction Web3 interactions
- **Creator Search & Verification**: Check authenticity and impersonation status across platforms
- **Multi-Platform Flagging**: Report suspicious content on Twitter, Discord, Telegram, YouTube
- **Authority Delegation**: Creators can register and delegate reputation management to trusted parties
- **Flag Management**: Trusted authorities handle community reports and maintain creator reputation

### 🤖 Telegram Bot
- **Real-Time Detection**: Fast identification of potentially malicious messages in Telegram groups
- **Privacy Preservation**: Anonymous reporting that protects both reporter and reported party identities
- **Instant Alerts**: Immediate notifications about suspicious content without revealing user data

Both clients interact with **Oasis Sapphire contracts** in a completely abstracted way, ensuring users benefit from Web3 privacy guarantees through familiar Web2 interfaces.
